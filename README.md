# syntappz-clothes
This is my first clothes site i learnt quite a lot about javascript making this site this is the most javascript i have wrote on my own so far, i would say this is my first proper site, i learnt how to use a loop to make the same animation happen to multiple objects which saved some code writing and this has made me understand loops a bit more, i learnt a lot about animations making this site and using setTimeout to make them run at diffent times, i also understand how to use parameters a lot better in functions now and using images in javascript too.
